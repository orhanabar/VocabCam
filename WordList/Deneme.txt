 

INTRODUCTION

A computer is a device that processes data
according to a set of instructions known

as a program. The equipment is known as

the hardware and the programs and data

are the software. A special set of programs,
called an operating system, provides an
interface for the user and allows applications
programs to communicate with the hardware.
Common applications programs include
wordprocessors for creating and editing texts,
spreadsheets for calculating mathematical
formulae and databases for storing data in a
way that allows the data to be sorted and
searched. Anti-virus programs are used to
detect and remove viruses (harmful programs
that can reproduce themselves and attach
themselves to other programs). Some
operating systems have graphical (user)
interfaces that allow the computer user to
select items from menus (lists of choices) and
to start programs using an input device called
a mouse. This is done by pressing a button on
the mouse i.e. clicking the mouse. The main
device for inputting the data is a typewriter-
style keyboard and the output is commonly
displayed on a monitor screen that looks like
a small television screen.

There is a range of sizes and types of
computer. Those designed for use by one
person at a time are known as personal
computers (PCs) although the term PC is
usually only applied to personal computers
that are compatible with the standards laid
down by the company known as IBM
(International Business Machines). Personal
computers include desktop computers (for
use on an ofﬁce desk) and handheld
computers that can be carried around by the
user. Electronics can be added to desktop
computers by plugging in expansion cards
(electronic circuit boards that can be plugged
into special sockets called expansion slots).

It is also possible to build all the main parts
of a computer into one electronic integrated
circuit packaged as a single electronic chip
(the common name for a microchip; an
electronic integrated circuit in a small
package) i.e. the ‘computer on a chip’. This
enables computers to be built into other
devices including household devices such as
washing machines and fridges and to be
incorporated into plastic cards i.e. smart
cards, which are able to store information
such as health records, drivers’ licences,
bank balances, etc. Devices that include a
computer circuit are commonly referred to as
smart devices. A multimedia computer can
process different forms of data including
text, graphics, audio (sound), animation and
video. This enables computer systems to be
used for a combination of education and
entertainment, sometimes referred to as
edutainment.

Unlike most machines, computers do not
have a ﬁxed purpose. They are multi-purpose
tools. They can be used in a very wide variety
of situations and are found in a wide range of
systems including security systems, cars and
phones. Advanced systems, known as expert
systems, enable computers to ‘think’ like
experts. Medical expert systems, for example,
can help doctors diagnose an illness and
decide on the best treatment. As computer
systems are developed, they are becoming
more common and are gradually being used
for more and more purposes. How they are
developed, and for what purposes they are
actually used in the future, can be inﬂuenced
by computer users. A variety of devices known
as peripherals can be added externally to a
computer. One of the most common
peripherals is a printer used for printing the
computer output (the processed data or
signals that come out of a computer system)

on paper. A digital camera allows
photographs to be input to a computer for
editing.

Not all computer systems are compatible
i.e. they cannot use the same programs and
data. Connecting computers together to form
a network can provide the ‘connectivity’
required to enable computers and software
to communicate and to share resources.
Networks connected together form an
internet. The connection of networks
throughout the world is known as the Internet
(note that a capital I is used) or, more simply,
the Net. Various communication services are
available on the Internet, including email
(electronic mail) for sending and receiving
text messages and IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
which allows users to communicate using text
messages in real-time i.e. without any delay,
while the users are logged on (connected to a
network system account, normally using a
password) to the system. An Internet service
called FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for
transferring data or program ﬁles between the
powerful server computers that provide the
network services and the client computers
that use these services e.g. downloading
music files. Note that copying data from a
larger server system to a client is referred to
as downloading and copying from the client
to the server is known as uploading.

One of the newest and most popular
services available on the Internet is the World
Wide Web (WWW) which is often simply
referred to as the Web (note the use of the
capital W). The Web contains interlinked
documents called webpages. A set of related
webpages stored together on a server
computer is called a website. Websites, such
as Dogpile and Askjeeves, give the user

access to special programs called search
engines that are designed to allow the userto
ﬁnd relevant webpages on the Web. An
Internet system designed to provide free,
interactive access to vast resources for people
all over the world is sometimes referred to as
an information superhighway.

Services such as these allow people to
telecommute (use their computers to stay in
touch with the ofﬁce while they are working
at home). Computer uses mentioned in this
unit include producing greetings cards;
learning, using three-dimensional graphics
programs called ‘Splat the Cat’ and ‘Pets 3';
using the Microsoft Word wordprocessing
program including features such as clipart
(ready-drawn graphic images that can be
inserted into documents); communicating on
the Internet using email and chat programs
Including the use of email attachments (other
types of ﬁles e.g. video ﬁles attached to
simple email text messages); distance
learning and videoconferencing (a form of
communication over a network that uses
video cameras so that the people taking part
can see and hear each other); electronic
classrooms or boardrooms; browsing the Web
(moving from webpage to webpage using a
Web browser program); selling, using a
website; painting; scanning pictures;
downloading music and creating CD-ROMS
(compact disk read only memory, commonly
referred to as CD5). CD-ROMS are storage
devices that use laser light for reading and
writing data. The most common storage
device is a hard disk (a set of aluminium
disks coated in a magnetic material and
enclosed in a vacuum-sealed case) used for
storing the operating system and applications
programs as well as the user's data.
